About amtc-web
==============

amtc-web is a web frontend for the C tool amtc. amtc-web is distributed alongside
amtc and is intended for any user willing to power manage and control a fleet of
Intel vPro/AMT or AMD DASH equipped hosts. While amtc itself is a command line to
used to quickly control hosts, amtc-web tries to visually make most out of the information
that can be gathered via vPro, logs states and allows comfortable scheduled power management.

amtc was intially developed to power-control a single room equipped with 170 PCs.
For more than a year now, it was used to monitor and control about 500 of them.
It IS a fun project, currently allowing me to play with [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/).
